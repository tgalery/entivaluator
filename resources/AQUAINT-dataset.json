It involves a  three dimensional   method known as  Stereotaxic Surgery  , which is also used in conjunction with  radiation   equipment known as the  Linear Accelerator  . \n\n With this new technology, doctors are able to removal cancerous tissues embedded deep inside the brain or near sensitive organs that makes normal surgery very difficult and risky. With radio surgery, every step is controlled by computers and patients are  conscious   while they undergo treatment. \n\n This new technique is also capable of treating diseases such as Artero Venous  Malformation   (the  clotting   of veins or blood  capillaries  in the brain).So far, ninety per cent of the radio surgery treatments have been successful and patients only have to remain in hospital for three days. Additionally, there is no need for patients to shave their heads and radio surgery causes no scar, little blood loss and is not expensive.For more information contact the hospital at srisiam ksc.th.com. \n\n","annotatedSpot":[{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"brain tumours","start":87,"end":100,"entity":37284,"wikiname":"Brain_tumor","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"breast cancer","start":118,"end":131,"entity":70547,"wikiname":"Breast_cancer","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"haemorrhage","start":145,"end":156,"entity":146315,"wikiname":"Bleeding","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"Bangkok","start":251,"end":258,"entity":56615,"wikiname":"Bangkok","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"Radio Surgery","start":297,"end":310,"entity":1172094,"wikiname":"Radiosurgery","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"Thailand","start":327,"end":335,"entity":30128,"wikiname":"Thailand","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"cancerous","start":506,"end":515,"entity":105219,"wikiname":"Cancer","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"tissues","start":529,"end":536,"entity":103915,"wikiname":"Tissue_(biology)","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"three dimensional","start":555,"end":572,"entity":3054853,"wikiname":"Three-dimensional_space","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"Stereotaxic Surgery","start":592,"end":611,"entity":1189445,"wikiname":"Stereotactic_surgery","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"radiation","start":655,"end":664,"entity":25856,"wikiname":"Radiation","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"Linear Accelerator","start":691,"end":709,"entity":273524,"wikiname":"Linear_particle_accelerator","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"conscious","start":972,"end":981,"entity":5664,"wikiname":"Consciousness","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"Malformation","start":1096,"end":1108,"entity":321263,"wikiname":"Congenital_disorder","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"clotting","start":1117,"end":1125,"entity":212193,"wikiname":"Coagulation","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19980603_0791.htm","spot":"capillaries","start":1147,"end":1158,"entity":56512,"wikiname":"Capillary","confidenceScore":0.0}]}

Botha   would be put on trial for abuses committed during  white rule  . \n\n Prosecutor Jan D'Oliveira said he currently has insufficient evidence to prosecute Botha, but that information collected by the  Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)  , which investigated apartheid-era abuses, still must be evaluated to ascertain whether charges would ultimately be brought. \n\n Last month, the Truth Comission issued a landmark report on its findings. It said Botha had ordered the 1987 bombing of the  African National Congress  ' London headquarters and the 1988 bombing of a  Johannesburg   building housing an anti-apartheid group. \n\n When Botha was head of state in the 1980s, thousands of people were detained without trial. Many were tortured and others killed. \n\n The commission can grant  amnesty   to those who fully confess to politically motivated abuses committed during apartheid.

It came after seasonal warming  evaporated   the  carbon dioxide    ice sheet   that caps the  Martian north pole   during part of the year. \n\n \n\n Officials said the storm was three times larger than a storm spotted 20 years ago by the  Viking Orbiter   spacecraft. \n\n \n\n Astronomers used a  wide field planetary camera   on Hubble to photograph Mars during the planet's closest approach to Earth in nearly eight years. \n\n \n\n Two pictures, taken six hours apart on April 27, showed that the storm moved slightly eastward. In the second picture, the storm appeared to be in the process of breaking up. \n\n \n\n Later pictures by the Hubble camera failed to find the storm, and astronomers said it could have been a short-lived  phenomenon . \n\n","annotatedSpot":[{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"Astronomers","start":4,"end":15,"entity":580,"wikiname":"Astronomer","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"cyclone","start":61,"end":68,"entity":42806,"wikiname":"Cyclone","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"Texas","start":95,"end":100,"entity":29810,"wikiname":"Texas","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"Mars","start":157,"end":161,"entity":14640471,"wikiname":"Mars","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"space telescope","start":190,"end":205,"entity":29006,"wikiname":"Space_observatory","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"Space Telescope Science Institute","start":244,"end":277,"entity":177098,"wikiname":"Space_Telescope_Science_Institute","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"Hubble Space Telescope","start":306,"end":328,"entity":40203,"wikiname":"Hubble_Space_Telescope","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"Martian","start":363,"end":370,"entity":47792,"wikiname":"Martian","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"ice","start":404,"end":407,"entity":14946,"wikiname":"Ice","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"hurricanes","start":600,"end":610,"entity":8282374,"wikiname":"Tropical_cyclone","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"Earth","start":617,"end":622,"entity":9228,"wikiname":"Earth","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"evaporated","start":749,"end":759,"entity":10303,"wikiname":"Evaporation","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"carbon dioxide","start":767,"end":781,"entity":5906,"wikiname":"Carbon_dioxide","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"ice sheet","start":785,"end":794,"entity":493760,"wikiname":"Ice_sheet","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"Martian north pole","start":812,"end":830,"entity":7723558,"wikiname":"Planum_Boreum","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"Viking Orbiter","start":954,"end":968,"entity":38082,"wikiname":"Viking_program","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"wide field planetary camera","start":1009,"end":1036,"entity":885509,"wikiname":"Wide_Field_and_Planetary_Camera","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"APW19990519_0141.htm","spot":"phenomenon","start":1441,"end":1451,"entity":60931,"wikiname":"Phenomenon","confidenceScore":0.0}]}

If the bear is judged to pose a continuing threat to humans it may be killed. \n\n \n\n Troopers said Cates' .280-caliber  rifle   and two spent shell casings were found near the body, along with traces of blood that suggest that Cates may have wounded the animal. \n\n \n\n \"We don't know if one was a warning shot and one real, or if there were two real shots,'' Bartley said. \n\n \n\n Cates' death is the first fatal bear mauling in Alaska since Feb. 8, 1998, when  Audelio Luis Cortes  , 40, was killed while working on a  seismic   crew in the  Swanson River    oil field   near  Kenai .
