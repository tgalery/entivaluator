{"docId":"Bus16451112.txt","text":"Home Depot CEO Nardelli quits \nHome-improvement retailer's chief executive had been criticized over pay \n \nATLANTA - Bob Nardelli abruptly resigned Wednesday as chairman and chief executive of The Home Depot Inc. after a six-year tenure that saw the world\u2019s largest home improvement store chain post big profits but left investors disheartened by poor stock performance. \n \nNardelli has also been under fire by investors for his hefty pay and is leaving with a severance package valued at about $210 million. He became CEO in December 2000 after being passed over for the top job at General Electric Co., where Nardelli had been a senior executive. \n \nHome Depot said Nardelli was being replaced by Frank Blake, its vice chairman, effective immediately. \n \nBlake\u2019s appointment is permanent, Home Depot spokesman Jerry Shields said. What he will be paid was not immediately disclosed, Shields said. The company declined to make Blake available for comment, and a message left for Nardelli with his secretary was not immediately returned. \n \nBefore Wednesday\u2019s news, Home Depot\u2019s stock had been down more than 3 percent on a split-adjusted basis since Nardelli took over. \n \nNardelli\u2019s sudden departure was stunning in that he told The Associated Press as recently as Sept. 1 that he had no intention of leaving, and a key director also said that the board was pleased with Nardelli despite the uproar by some investors. \n \nAsked in that interview if he had thought of hanging up his orange apron and leaving Home Depot, Nardelli said unequivocally that he hadn\u2019t. Asked what he thought he would be doing 10 years from now, Nardelli said, \u201cSelling hammers.\u201d \n \nFor The Home Depot? \n \n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said at the time. \n \nHome Depot said Nardelli\u2019s decision to resign was by mutual agreement with the Atlanta-based company. \n \n\u201cWe are very grateful to Bob for his strong leadership of The Home Depot over the past six years. Under Bob\u2019s tenure, the company made significant and necessary investments that greatly improved the company\u2019s infrastructure and operations, expanded our markets to include wholesale distribution and new geographies, and undertook key strategic initiatives to strengthen the company\u2019s foundation for the future,\u201d Home Depot\u2019s board said in a statement. \n \nNardelli was a nuts-and-bolts leader, a former college football player and friend of President Bush. He helped increase revenue and profits at Home Depot and increase the number of stores the company operates to more than 2,000. Home Depot\u2019s earnings per share have increased by approximately 150 percent over the last five years. But the public discussion about his pay and the company\u2019s stock price had become a distraction. \n \nIndustry experts and analysts said his departure and Blake\u2019s ascent to the top job are a good thing for Home Depot. \n \n\u201cThis is not about strategy or vision,\u201d said James Senn, director of Robinson College\u2019s Center for Global Business Leadership at Georgia State University. \u201cThis is coming down to two things. Really the foundation of leadership is credibility. Bob has run into some problems there. The second is execution.\u201d \n \nThe Home Depot board also announced that Carol Tome, its chief financial officer, and Joe DeAngelo, its executive vice president for Home Depot Supply, will be assuming additional responsibilities. \n \nTome will be assuming responsibility for mergers and acquisitions, credit services and additional strategic responsibilities. DeAngelo was appointed to the newly created position of chief operating officer. \n \nNardelli and Home Depot have agreed to terms of a separation agreement that would provide for payment of the amounts he is entitled to receive under his pre-existing employment contract entered into in 2000. Under this agreement, Nardelli will receive consideration currently valued at about $210 million. \n \nThe package includes a cash severance payment of $20 million, the acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards currently valued at approximately $77 million and unvested options with an intrinsic value of approximately $7 million. It also includes payments of earned bonuses and long-term incentive awards of approximately $9 million, account balances under the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan and other benefit programs currently valued at approximately $2 million, previously earned and vested deferred shares with an approximate value of $44 million, the present value of retirement benefits currently valued at approximately $32 million and $18 million for other entitlements under his contract. Those entitlements will be paid over a four-year period and will be forfeited if he does not honor his contractual obligations. \n \nNardelli has also agreed not to compete with the company for one year, and not to solicit employees or customers of the company for four years. \n \nHome Depot did not say what Nardelli would be doing next. \n \nIn conjunction with the management changes, the board also announced that it had waived the retirement age of 72 and has asked John L. Clendenin, Claudio X. Gonzales and Milledge A. Hart III to stand for re-election at the 2007 annual shareholders meeting. This action was taken to retain these directors\u2019 experience. Home Depot said the action was temporary. \n\n\n","annotatedSpot":[{"docId":"Bus16451112.txt","spot":"Home

{"docId":"Bus3683270.txt","text":"Stocks start new trading year with rally \nMarket indexes surge after Home Depot chief executive quits \n \nNEW YORK - Stocks moved soundly higher in the first session of 2007 as investors cheered mostly solid readings on the economy and found reason for increased prospects for big-name retailers Home Depot Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. \n \nA decline in oil prices added to the strong sentiment that at times drove the Dow Jones industrials to a new trading high. \n \nStocks, which had surged from the start on word that Home Depot\u2019s chairman and chief executive had resigned after years of lackluster performance in the company\u2019s stock, added to their gains after Wall Street received a stronger-than-expected report on December manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management and saw a softer-than-expected decline in construction spending. \n \n\u201cThe ISM number was better than expected and construction fell less than expected,\u201d said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards. \u201cI think those of us looking for a soft landing had more support on that stance today.\u201d \n \nIn early afternoon trading, the Dow surged 96.53, or 0.77 percent, to 12,559.68 after jumping earlier to a new trading high of 12,580.35. \n \nBroader stock indicators also rose, with the Nasdaq composite index especially showing sharp gains. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index was up 7.94, or 0.56 percent, at 1,426.24, and the tech-laden Nasdaq rose 32.92, or 1.36 percent, to 2,448.21. \n \nBonds rose but retreated from an earlier big advance; the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.68 percent from 4.71 percent late Friday. Bond investors were trying to balance the ISM news with a weak employment report from a division of payroll company Automatic Data Processing Inc. ADP said private sector employment fell by 40,000 in December following three months of gains that averaged 121,000 per month; investors theorized that the report might improve the chances for an interest rate cut in the early part of the year. \n \nThe dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices fell. \n \nLight, sweet crude fell $2.44 to $58.61 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as mild weather continued its hold over much of the United States, cutting demand for heating oil and natural gas. \n \nWith markets closed Tuesday to mark the funeral of President Gerald R. Ford, Wall Street returned from its longest hiatus \u2014 four days \u2014 since the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Shortly after they returned to work, investors received word that the ISM index came in at 51.4, stronger than the reading of 50 that had been expected. A reading above 50 signals expansion in the manufacturing sector; November\u2019s figure of 49.5 marked the first time the report showed contraction in nearly four years. \n \nAlso giving a boost to stocks, construction spending dropped by a less-than-expected 0.2 percent in November as housing activity fell for a record eighth straight month. The Commerce Department reported that building activity edged down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.18 trillion. \n \n\u201cBasically, we\u2019re still in an up market even though it\u2019s 51 months old,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cThis is still a market that has good upside momentum.\u201d \n \nNews that Bob Nardelli resigned from the world\u2019s largest home improvement chain added to positive investor sentiment from a weekend report that Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\u2019s December same-store sales rose 1.6 percent, topping the company\u2019s forecast that growth would be flat or up as much as 1 percent. Home Depot rose $1.35, or 3.4 to $41.51, while Wal-Mart advanced $1.53, or 3.3 percent, to $47.71. \n \nIn corporate news, Cytokinetics Inc. surged $1.05, or 14 percent, to $8.53 on news it would work with Amgen Inc. to develop drugs to combat heart failure. Amgen rose 72 cents to $69.03. \n \nSirius Satellite Radio Inc. rose 27 cents, or 7.6 percent, to $3.81 after the radio service said its subscriber base jumped 82 percent to more than 6 million last year. \n \nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Co. advanced $1.79, or 8.5 percent, to $22.78 and moved as high as $22.77 to surpass a 52-week high of $21.35 after a three-month strike that had hurt production ended. \n \nHome builders were weaker after Lennar Corp., the biggest U.S. builder, warned that it expects to post a loss in the fourth quarter and its chief executive said he see no signs of a recovery in the housing market. Lennar fell $1.40, or 2.7 percent, to $51.06. \n \nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.13 billion shares, compared with 430.7 million traded at the same point Friday, a day of anemic volume ahead of the New Year\u2019s holiday. \n \nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 5.96, or 0.76 percent, at 793.62. \n \nOverseas, Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock average rose 0.01 percent.

{"docId":"Hea16384904.txt","text":"Resolution to imbibe less goes awry \u2014 already \nMyriad of conflicting medical studies are enough to drive this writer to drink \n \nThe fruitcake\u2019s been digested, the gift cards are empty, and now it\u2019s time to face the most grueling holiday task of all: the annual reassessment. Do I need to exercise more? Spend less? Set aside more quality time for friends and family? The resolution list goes on and on \u2014 much like that interminable karaoke version of \u201cSanta Baby\u201d at this year\u2019s holiday party. \n \nUnfortunately, since I was the one holding the microphone, this year\u2019s resolution seems painfully clear: Cut back on the alcohol intake. \n \nNot that I drink a lot \u2014 usually just a glass of wine with dinner, if that \u2014 but I\u2019ve read that even one drink a day can adversely affect my health. \n \nAlso, a recent study by the Mayo Clinic found that women\u2019s bodies are less adept at breaking down alcohol than men\u2019s. As a result, the more we drink, the more we risk heart disease, cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, and, perhaps the most chilling side effect of all \u2014 kissing our skinny jeans goodbye forever. \n \nBut how much alcohol is too much? There\u2019s the rub. The answer seems to depend on which study you read. The Mayo Clinic study says one drink a day is OK for \u201cyounger women who aren\u2019t planning a pregnancy\u201d and that \u201cpostmenopausal women should limit themselves to less.\u201d But what about those of us who don\u2019t fit in either category? \n \nLooking for a definitive answer, I turned to another study, this one conducted by a group of doctors at Stony Brook University in New York. But their finding that drinking three glasses of red wine a week reduces the risk of colorectal cancer only confused matters further. \n \nWho to believe? \nShould I cut back on alcohol entirely in order to fend off heart disease, liver problems and dreaded weight gain (not to mention potential blackmail opportunities by family, friends and co-workers) or suck down three or more glasses a week to keep the colorectal cancer at bay?  \n \nOr should I listen to the doctors the Goteborg University in Sweden, who found that mice that had ingested low levels of alcohol on a daily basis showed a significantly lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis than mice that just drank water. Obsessed, I started digging through medical journals and online health stories until the studies began to stack up like swizzle sticks at a company-hosted bar. \n \nIn London, researchers found that people who drank alcohol have a lower risk of developing non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, but the risk of cancer of the mouth, esophagus and liver actually increases. \n \nAt Ohio State University, a study showed that drinking moderately (such as a couple of drinks a day) improved the memories of laboratory rats, although a study at the University of Missouri declared that alcohol hindered academic success. \n \nLive longer so you can die young \nAdding it all up, it seems that by drinking alcohol I can both reduce my chances of heart disease and increase my risk for high blood pressure, fend off dementia while upping my chances for brain damage, boost my memory at the same time that I become more stupid, avoid lymphoma while veering towards breast and liver cancer, and in general, both live longer and die younger. \n \nIn other words, alcohol is every bit the hazy hypocritical demon it\u2019s always been (especially when there\u2019s a microphone involved). So this year, I\u2019m taking another resolution route altogether. Instead of squelching my alcohol intake, I\u2019m going to cut out karaoke \u2014 and perhaps limit my medical studies to just one per day with dinner, if that. \n \n\n\n","annotatedSpot":[{"docId":"Hea16384904.txt","spot":"Santa Baby","start":453,"end":463,"entity":4386087,"wikiname":"Santa_Baby","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Hea16384904.txt","spot":"Mayo Clinic","start":818,"end":829,"entity":160843,"wikiname":"Mayo_Clinic","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Hea16384904.txt","spot":"Mayo Clinic","start":1208,"end":1219,"entity":160843,"wikiname":"Mayo_Clinic","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Hea16384904.txt","spot":"Stony Brook University","start":1538,"end":1560,"entity":0,"wikiname":"State_University_of_New_York_at_Stony_Brook","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Hea16384904.txt","spot":"New York","start":1564,"end":1572,"entity":645042,"wikiname":"New_York_City","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Hea16384904.txt","spot":"Goteborg University","start":2048,"end":2067,"entity":0,"wikiname":"Goteborg_University","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Hea16384904.txt","spot":"Sweden","start":2071,"end":2077,"entity":5058739,"wikiname":"Sweden","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Hea16384904.txt","spot":"London","start":2424,"end":2430,"entity":17867,"wikiname":"London","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Hea16384904.txt","spot":"Hodgkin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lymphoma","start":2516,"end":2534,"entity":23713759,"wikiname":"Hodgkin's_lymphoma","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Hea16384904.txt","spot":"Ohio State University","start":2619,"end":2640,"entity":22217,"wikiname":"Ohio_State_University","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Hea16384904.txt","spot":"University of Missouri","start":2783,"end":2805,"entity":0,"wikiname":"University_of_Missouri-Columbia","confidenceScore":0.0}]}
{"docId":"Hea16451212.txt","text":"Health insurance bridges gap for poor families \nFree medical care can help children get out of poverty, official says \n \nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. - For years, Al Rohling watched parents quit their jobs when their kids got sick, deliberately making their incomes drop to a point where they could get U.S. government medical help. \n \nRohling, who directed Alabama\u2019s housing authority at the time, reached a startling conclusion: If children could drive parents into hardship when they became ill, could medical insurance help parents rediscover financial health? \n \n\u201cHealth care for children really is a bridge to get out of poverty,\u201d said Rohling. \n \nRohling quit his job in 1988 to help set up the Child Caring Foundation, which provides free health insurance for children through the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama health care provider. \n \nThe foundation is just one example of a charity that bridges the gap between Medicaid \u2014 subsidized insurance \u2014 for the poorest and private health insurance paid for either privately for those who can afford it, or by an employer. \n \nThat gap leaves up to 9 million U.S. children uninsured in the United States, a nation with no universal health care. Many parents are forced to struggle with a patchwork of other provisions in order to get health care for their children. \n \n\u201cThe problem of the uninsured is getting worse,\u201d and the number of uninsured children has risen since 2004, said Jennifer Tolbert, principal analyst with the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, a Washington-based think tank. \n \nTolbert said it was possible the U.S. Congress could increase the scope of the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to provide greater state coverage for uninsured children when it debates reauthorizing the program next year. \n \nIn the lurch \nChildren with health insurance are usually taken to the doctor at the first sign of illness, while parents of uninsured kids often wait because they are conscious of the cost. \n \nThen the child\u2019s illness can worsen and the parent is forced to miss work to nurse the child back to health. \n \nIn Alabama, there were 230,000 uninsured children in 1988, and that has fallen to around 70,000 due to a combination of the Child Caring Foundation and state programs. \n \nJody Sharp, 60, is an example of the problem the charity aims to address. \n \nShe and her husband adopted a foster child, Dana, from a mother who was mentally handicapped. Later, they adopted Dana\u2019s brother Kyle who has epilepsy and asthma. \n \nBut Sharp\u2019s husband, the family wage earner, walked out in 1990, leaving Sharp to bring up the two children with no health insurance. \n \n\u201cIf you never had a child with epilepsy, you would never know how many bills you can incur. With no insurance, it\u2019s thousands of dollars just like that,\u201d Sharp told Reuters. \n \nDuring their two years in the Alabama Blue Cross Blue Shield program, Sharp\u2019s children received free medical care and she found a job working with special needs children. The money saved helped her move into private health insurance. \n \nSome 90 percent of the 55,000 children on the program move into private health insurance within about 30 months. \n \n\u201cAll of us have times when we lose jobs or lose our homes. You need the support of insurance so you don\u2019t have to worry about squeezing doctor bills out of an already stretched paycheck,\u201d said Sharp. \n \nBear's eye \nTo recruit families, Rohling tours the state presenting health screenings at schools with the help of volunteers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing and elsewhere. \n \nAt one recent presentation, a student nurse pulled a teddy bear eye out of a child\u2019s ear, ending three years of one-sided deafness. It was an example of how problems can fester for children who don\u2019t have health insurance. \n \nLow cost health insurance for low income American children began in Pittsburgh in 1985 when Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western Pennsylvania insured children of laid-off steel workers. By 2006, 144,000 children were in their program. \n \n\u201cThere was a crisis. And the whole thing came about as an answer for how health insurance should work,\u201d said spokesperson Denise Grabner of Highmark. \n \nIn 1997, the program expanded to include children of the working poor when Congress enacted the SCHIP providing some matching funding. \n \nAlabama was the first of 20 states to participate, creating the All Kids program, with money from state settlement with tobacco companies. The program provides insurance for children above the level at which they would qualify for Medicaid. \n \nMany states now provide insurance for families who earn up to double the poverty rate, defined as $10,000 a year for a single person and $20,000 for a family of four. But Rohling said an individual needed to earn nearly three times the poverty level to afford private insurance. \n \n\u201cWe fill the void between affordability and eligibility.\u201d

{"docId":"Pol16447720.txt","text":"Mourners in Michigan welcome body of Ford  \nEx-president 'who meant so much' scheduled to be buried Wednesday \n \nGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. - Moving quietly and solemnly through the moonlight, mourners waited for a chance to file past the casket of Gerald R. Ford, welcoming home the 38th president for a final time and celebrating a man they said embodied Midwest values. \n \n\u201cThis is a once-in-lifetime opportunity to pay tribute,\u201d said Karin Lewis, 44, who brought her five boys, ages 6 to 15, to Ford\u2019s presidential museum to pay respects Tuesday night. \u201cHe meant so much to this community.\u201d \n \nFord\u2019s state funeral was to end Wednesday afternoon after a service at Grace Episcopal Church in East Grand Rapids. His body was to be interred during a private burial overlooking the Grand River north of the museum on the museum grounds. \n \nDonald Rumsfeld, who served in Ford\u2019s cabinet as his chief of staff and as his defense secretary, was to deliver a eulogy. Former President Jimmy Carter, who defeated Ford in 1976 but later became a close friend of his former opponent, and Richard Norton Smith, who used to be the director of the Ford museum and presidential library, also were scheduled to speak. \n \nFinal salute \nOn Tuesday, members of the public jammed streets and waved as Ford\u2019s casket was carried from the Grand Rapids airport, where it arrived following services at Washington National Cathedral. \n \n\u201cYou were a paradoxical gift of remarkable intellect and achievement wrapped in a plain brown wrapper,\u201d Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm said of Ford. \u201cWelcome home to the people that you reflected so well when you were in Washington.\u201d \n \nLater, members of the public walked from the DeVos Place convention center across a bridge over the Grand River to the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum for a final salute. \n \nSome wore formal suits and dresses. Others wore sweat shirts from University of Michigan, where Ford played center on the Wolverines\u2019 undefeated national championship football teams of 1932 and 1933. \n \n\u201cI grew up in Grand Rapids, and President Ford was our legacy,\u201d said Bobbe Taber, 43, who now lives in the Kalamazoo area but came to Grand Rapids to see Ford\u2019s casket. \n \nMichigan National Guard spokeswoman Lynn Chapp said 60,000 people were expected to walk by the casket from the time repose began around 6 p.m. Tuesday until it was scheduled to end at 11 a.m. Wednesday. Lines snaked along several blocks in the city\u2019s downtown as people waited their turn Tuesday night. \n \n'The best of America' \nThe service Wednesday at his hometown church, which seats about 350, was to be much smaller than Tuesday\u2019s elaborate national funeral service in Washington, which drew 3,000 people. President Bush and his father spoke Tuesday, as did NBC newsman Tom Brokaw and Ford\u2019s secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, among others. \n \n\u201cIn President Ford, the world saw the best of America, and America found a man whose character and leadership would bring calm and healing to one of the most divisive moments in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d President Bush said in his eulogy. \n \nBush\u2019s father, the first President Bush, called Ford a \u201cNorman Rockwell painting come to life\u201d and pierced the solemnity of the occasion by cracking gentle jokes about Ford\u2019s reputation as an errant golfer. He said Ford knew his golf game was getting better when he began hitting fewer spectators. \n \nUnder towering arches of the cathedral, Kissinger paid tribute to Ford\u2019s leadership in achieving nuclear arms control with the Soviets, pushing for the first political agreement between Israel and Egypt and helping to bring majority rule to southern Africa. \n \n\u201cIn his understated way he did his duty as a leader, not as a performer playing to the gallery,\u201d Kissinger said. \u201cGerald Ford had the virtues of small town America.\u201d \n \nBrokaw said in his eulogy that Ford brought to office \u201cno demons, no hidden agenda, no hit list or acts of vengeance,\u201d an oblique reference to the air of subterfuge that surrounded Nixon in his final days. \n \nFord\u2019s athletic interest was honored, too, in the capital and in Michigan. At the Grand Rapids airport that bears Ford\u2019s name, the University of Michigan band played the school\u2019s famous fight song, \u201cThe Victors,\u201d as Ford\u2019s flag-draped casket was transferred to a hearse. \n \nFord died at 93 on Dec. 26 at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. \n\n\n","annotatedSpot":[{"docId":"Pol16447720.txt","spot":"Michigan","start":12,"end":20,"entity":18859,"wikiname":"Michigan","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Pol16447720.txt","spot":"Ford","start":37,"end":41,"entity":5030380,"wikiname":"Gerald_Ford","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Pol16447720.txt","spot":"GRAND RAPIDS","start":113,"end":125,"entity":24109126,"wikiname":"Grand_Rapids,_Michigan","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Pol16447720.txt","spot":"Mich.","start":127,"end":132,"entity":18859,"wikiname":"Michigan","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Pol16447720.txt","spot":"Gerald R.

{"docId":"Pol16452612.txt","text":"Evolving presidential preferences \nHow will American voters compensate in the next search for a president? \n \nWASHINGTON - Now that the 38th president has been laid to rest, the capital can take up the main business of 2007: trying to figure out who will be the 44th.  What type of leader does the country want? Here is my sense of it, based on talking to politicians, strategists and voters here and around the nation. \n \nNo ideologues, please \nThere was a time when President George W. Bush\u2019s ideological certitude was politically appealing and perhaps functionally necessary. That time has long since passed. The country is tired, even fearful, of leaders with fervent beliefs that seem impervious to new (or even old) facts. Voters see the war in Iraq as an \u201cidea,\u201d not a solution \u2013 and Americans do not like ideas that do not work.  Voters likely will view Bush\u2019s \u201csurge\u201d of troops into Iraq as new evidence of failure, and the dangers of a leader who depends on preconceived ideas. \n \nSerious student \nPresidential elections are a never-ending series of mid-course corrections. Voters look to compensate for the leadership weaknesses of the incumbent. An example comes from the life and career of Gerald Ford. In 1976, voters wanted a pure antidote to Richard Nixon\u2019s paranoid megalomania. Once Ford pardoned Nixon, he could not be that candidate. Instead, Americans chose Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer who had never worked in Washington, and who promised never to lie to the American people. The counterpoint thinking continues. Voters in 2008 are going to want someone who prides himself (or herself) on spending time in the library \u2013 who has a hands-on curiosity about the details. \n \nWashington experience not necessary \nVoters these days not only do not value Washington experience \u2013 or any office-holding experience \u2013 it can make them suspicious. That is what strategists and polltakers for Sen. Evan Bayh found when they studied whether he should run for president. They found that his remarkably deep resume \u2013 the son of a senator, he was the \u201cboy governor\u201d of Indiana before going to the Senate \u2013 was as handicap. Americans always are dubious about the capital, but that sentiment seems particularly strong. Bayh decided not to run. \u201c`Washington\u2019 doesn\u2019t make the case,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, who worked for Bayh. \n \nNo more boomer obsessions \nNot all elections are about change, but 2008 will be. Americans are moderately upbeat about the country\u2019s prospects, but deeply worried about the world \u2013 and they have come to realize that they can\u2019t separate one from the other. One thing for sure, says Pfeiffer, voters are tired of arguing about the culture of the 1960s and other Boomer issues.  \u201cThere is a sense that the 2004 election was too much about who did or did not do what in Vietnam,\u201d said Pfeiffer, referring to the Bush campaign against Sen. John Kerry. In 2000, Bush won in part by selling himself as a \u201cgrown up\u201d Boomer answer to Bill Clinton. \u201cVoters are tired of that era and its concerns,\u201d said Pfeiffer said. \u201cThey want to move on.\u201d \n \nKnow the middle class \nBushes have a congenital family problem with this, and it leaves an opening for someone \u2013 of either party \u2013 who can prove that he or she really understands the strains of middle class life. It\u2019s not just about money, but about cultural assaults and the lack of time for family in an era when both parents or partners need to work. In his forthcoming book, Positively American, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York imagines the hard life of a fictitious middle class family \u2013 and offers a series of governmental proposals to address them. A shrewd student of the American mood, Schumer is aiming in the right direction. The next president will need to show that he or she understands that family. \n\n\n","annotatedSpot":[{"docId":"Pol16452612.txt","spot":"WASHINGTON","start":110,"end":120,"entity":108956,"wikiname":"Washington,_D.C.","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Pol16452612.txt","spot":"President George W.

{"docId":"Spo16417540.txt","text":"Saban leaves Dolphins for Alabama job \nCoach ends speculation, takes offer of 8 years, $32 million \u2014 all guaranteed \n \nDAVIE, Fla. - Nick Saban is \u2019Bama bound. \n \nEnding five weeks of denials and two days of deliberation, Saban accepted the Alabama coaching job and abandoned his bid to rebuild the Miami Dolphins after only two seasons. \n \nESPN said the deal is for eight years and $32 million, all of it guaranteed. \n \nMiami owner Wayne Huizenga said he was informed of the decision in a meeting Wednesday at Saban\u2019s house. Huizenga announced the departure at a news conference that Saban didn\u2019t attend. \n \n\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Huizenga said, borrowing Saban\u2019s pet phrase. \u201cI\u2019m not upset because it\u2019s more involved than what you think.\u201d \n \nSince late November, Saban had issued frequent, angry public denials of interest in moving to Tuscaloosa. Huizenga said the change of heart wasn\u2019t driven by money, and Saban never sought a raise or contract extension. \n \nInstead, Huizenga hinted that family issues for Saban and his wife, Terry, were a factor. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve been through this with Nick for quite some time now, and I feel the pain and so forth and so on of Nick and Terry, and it\u2019s not a very simple thing,\u201d Huizenga said. \u201cI think Nick\u2019s great. I\u2019ll be Nick\u2019s biggest fan. I\u2019ll be cheering for him to win that bowl game.\u201d \n \nA preference for the college game and the campus lifestyle may have swayed Saban. He won a national championship at LSU and is 15-17 with the Dolphins. This was his first losing season in 13 years as a head coach. \n \nThe Crimson Tide first approached Saban shortly after firing Mike Shula. Huizenga has said he received repeated assurances from Saban that he would return in 2007, and two weeks ago Saban said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the Alabama coach.\u201d \n \nBut when the Dolphins\u2019 6-10 season ended Sunday, Alabama sweetened an offer that reportedly would make him the highest-paid coach in college football. He had three years remaining on his Miami contract at $4.5 million a year. \n \nIn the past, Huizenga has been persuasive when dealing with coaches. He talked Don Shula into retirement in 1996, talked Jimmy Johnson out of retiring three years later \u2014 Johnson lasted one more season \u2014 and was able to lure Saban to the pros in 2004 after other NFL teams had failed. \n \nBut this time, Huizenga failed to change Saban\u2019s mind. \n \nAfter Saban turned down the Tide in early December, Alabama offered the job to Rich Rodriguez, but he decided to stay at West Virginia. Alabama lost last week to Oklahoma State in the Independence Bowl to finish 6-7. \n \nPossible candidates to replace Saban include Chicago Bears defensive coordinator Ron Rivera, former Green Bay head coach Mike Sherman, San Diego Chargers offensive coordinator Cam Cameron, Indianapolis assistant Jim Caldwell, Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator Norm Chow and Pittsburgh Steelers assistants Russ Grimm and Ken Whisenhut. \n \nHuizenga didn\u2019t rule out hiring a college coach, as he did when Saban came to the Dolphins from LSU two years ago. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing I want to do, and it\u2019s win,\u201d Huizenga said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what it takes, what it costs, what\u2019s involved, we\u2019re going to make this a winning franchise. It\u2019s no fun owning a team if you\u2019re not winning, I can tell you that. And we are absolutely, positively going to get back to being a winning team. And sooner rather than later.\u201d \n \nLeading the search for a coach will be Joe Bailey, chief executive officer of Dolphins Enterprises, and Brian Wiedmeier, the Dolphins\u2019 president and chief operating officer. The Arizona Cardinals and Atlanta Falcons are also seeking a new coach. \n \nThe Dolphins\u2019 next coach will be their fourth in nine seasons. \n \n\u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t brought that up,\u201d Huizenga said with a wry smile. \n \nIt has been a frustrating a stretch of instability for a franchise that had the same coach \u2014 Shula \u2014 for 26 years. Miami has failed to make the playoffs the past five years, a team record. \n \nThe Dolphins are coming off their third losing season since 1969 and likely face a roster overhaul. With Daunte Culpepper struggling to recover from reconstructive knee surgery in 2005, Miami remains unsettled at quarterback, a troublesome position since Dan Marino retired seven years ago. The team needs upgrades in almost every other area for a feeble offense and aging defense. \n \nSaban leaves behind the NFL\u2019s largest staff of assistants and general manager Randy Mueller, who might be given more responsibility under a new coaching regime. \n \nThe Dolphins haven\u2019t reached the AFC championship game since Huizenga became majority owner in 1994. \n \n\u201cAll I want to figure out is how the heck we\u2019re going to win,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what everyone with the Dolphins wants, to win. So win, win, win. That\u2019s all I can say. We\u2019re going to go out there and kick some butt and make something happen, I guarantee you.\u201d \nNCAA

{"docId":"Tec16451635.txt","text":"30 panda cubs born in China in 2006 \nCurrent total of giant pandas bred in captivity now 217 \n \nBEIJING - A mini-baby boom last year has pushed up the number of pandas bred in captivity in China to 217, state media said Wednesday. \n \nSome 34 pandas were born by artificial insemination in 2006 and 30 survived \u2014 both record numbers for the endangered species, Cao Qingyao, a spokesman for the State Forestry Administration, was quoted as saying by the Xinhua News Agency. \n \nThe previous record was the 21 baby pandas born in China's zoos and breeding centers in 2005. \n \nChina has been raising pandas through artificial insemination for nearly 50 years, mostly at two research facilities in the southwestern province of Sichuan.

{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","text":"Upgrade makes aging Mars rovers smarter \nEngineers transmitted new software to the rovers' onboard computers \n \nLOS ANGELES - The twin Mars rovers are getting wiser with age. \n \nEngineers have transmitted new flight software to the rovers' onboard computers \u2014 just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The software is aimed at boosting their intelligence and independence so that they can roll around the Red Planet with less help from humans. \n \n\"We're teaching an old dog new tricks,\" said John Callas, the mission project manager with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the NASA agency in charge of the rovers. \n \nAmong the rovers' new skills is the ability to automatically recognize and transmit to Earth photographs that they take of swirling dust devils or floating clouds. They can also independently decide whether it is safe to extend its robotic arm to sample a piece of rock. \n \nBefore, scientists had to painstakingly dissect thousands of images just to find the frames they need and decide for the rovers whether to use their arms. The high-tech upgrades should help save time \u2014 as much as a day because scientists on Earth don't have to study a rock before sending commands to the robot to pick it up. \n \nIf successful, the changes could get incorporated into future Mars missions. \n \nSpirit and Opportunity were also fitted with a new navigation system that allows them to think several steps ahead when faced with an obstacle, allowing them to back out of a dead end or even navigate a maze on their own, Callas said. The geologic robots have previously tackled one problem at a time. \n \nSpirit landed three years ago Wednesday and Opportunity on Jan. 24, 2004. Entering their fourth year of exploration, both golf cart-sized vehicles have long outlasted their missions, originally planned for about three months. While scientists are impressed by the rovers' longevity, they admit the robots could die at any time. \n \nThe rovers' biggest accomplishment is uncovering geologic evidence that water once flowed on Mars. Spirit is currently studying rocks and soil samples near a Martian ridge while Opportunity is circling the rim of a massive crater for possible ways in. \n\n\n","annotatedSpot":[{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Mars rovers","start":20,"end":31,"entity":0,"wikiname":"Mars_Rover","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"LOS ANGELES","start":112,"end":123,"entity":0,"wikiname":"Los_Angeles._California","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Mars rovers","start":135,"end":146,"entity":0,"wikiname":"Mars_Rover","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Red Planet","start":420,"end":430,"entity":14640471,"wikiname":"Mars","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"John Callas","start":507,"end":518,"entity":0,"wikiname":"John_Callas","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory","start":557,"end":582,"entity":16459,"wikiname":"Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"NASA","start":588,"end":592,"entity":18426568,"wikiname":"NASA","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Earth","start":715,"end":720,"entity":9228,"wikiname":"Earth","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Earth","start":1143,"end":1148,"entity":9228,"wikiname":"Earth","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Mars","start":1293,"end":1297,"entity":14640471,"wikiname":"Mars","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Spirit","start":1311,"end":1317,"entity":0,"wikiname":"Spirit_rover","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Opportunity","start":1322,"end":1333,"entity":0,"wikiname":"Opportunity_rover","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Callas","start":1533,"end":1539,"entity":0,"wikiname":"John_Callas","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Spirit","start":1616,"end":1622,"entity":0,"wikiname":"Spirit_rover","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Opportunity","start":1660,"end":1671,"entity":0,"wikiname":"Opportunity_rover","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Mars","start":2040,"end":2044,"entity":14640471,"wikiname":"Mars","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Spirit","start":2046,"end":2052,"entity":0,"wikiname":"Spirit_rover","confidenceScore":0.0},{"docId":"Tec16454435.txt","spot":"Opportunity","start":2125,"end":2136,"entity":0,"wikiname":"Opportunity_rover","confidenceScore":0.0}]}

Make YOURSELF a priority \n*Shop for healthy foods your body needs \n*Get enough sleep \n*Exercise regularly \n \n2. Know your numbers \nRing in the New Year with a pledge to visit your doctor and learn your blood pressure reading and fasting cholesterol, triglyceride and blood sugar levels.  The sooner you know where you stand, the sooner you can take action to make corrections. \n \n*  Optimal blood pressure equal to or   120 \/ 80 mmHg \n*  Total cholesterol    200 mg\/dL \n*  LDL-Cholesterol    100 mg\/dL \n*  HDL-Cholesterol  40 mg\/dL or higher \n*  Cholesterol ratio  below 5  \n*  Triglycerides    150 mg\/dL \n*  Blood Sugars    100 mg\/dL \n \n3. Up your ante!  \nAntioxidants are naturally occurring compounds found in plant based foods. Antioxidants help the body fight many serious conditions, including cancer and heart disease, by thwarting the action of harmful free radicals. According to a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, July 2006, the following foods are among the richest in antioxidants. Go out of your way to incorporate them into your daily diet. \n \n1. Blackberries \n2. Walnuts \n3. Strawberries \n4. Artichokes   \n5. Cranberries \n6. Raspberries \n7. Blueberries \n8. Cloves, ground \n \n4. Incorporate whole grains \n2007 is the year to stop buying refined, white starch. Instead, embrace brown rice, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread and other healthy grain varieties like millet, faro, and amaranth.  \n \nLearn how to buy the right bread! Many consumers believe they're buying the right type of bread but are often confused. According to a Sara Lee Food & Beverage survey, 73% of consumers who were asked what type of bread they had in the house said \"whole wheat bread,\" but after checking the label realized that they mistakenly thought \"enriched wheat\" meant whole grain. \n \nLook a \"whole\" lot closer at labels in the bread aisle - it must say 100% Whole Wheat or 100% Whole Grain, or list the word WHOLE as one of the first ingredients on the label. \n \n5.   Slow the pace - lose fat on your waist  \nIn an interesting experiment that was presented at the 2006 Annual Scientific Meeting a NAASO, women were invited to eat a pasta lunch on two different days. On one day, the women were given a small spoon and asked to take small bites, put the spoon down between bites, and chew each bite at least 15 times. On the second day, the women were given a large spoon and asked to eat as quickly as possible without stopping between bites. On both occasions, the women ate until they felt comfortably full. When researchers measured how many calories the women ate, they found that women ate 67 more calories when they ate quickly than when they ate slowly.

{"docId":"USN16443053.txt","text":"Few areas in U.S. get high public safety ratings \nOnly 6 of 75 communities win highest scores for emergency communications \n \nWASHINGTON - Only six of 75 U.S. metropolitan areas won the highest grades for their emergency agencies' ability to communicate during a disaster, five years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to a federal report obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press. \n \nA draft portion of the report, to be released Wednesday, gives the best ratings to Washington, D.C.; San Diego; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Columbus, Ohio; Sioux Falls, S.D.; and Laramie County, Wyo. \n \nThe lowest scores went to Chicago; Cleveland; Baton Rouge, La.; Mandan, N.D.; and American Samoa. The report included large and small cities and their suburbs, along with U.S. territories. \n \nIn an overview, the report said all 75 areas surveyed have policies in place for helping their emergency workers communicate. But it cautioned that regular testing and exercises are needed \"to effectively link disparate systems.\" \n \nIt also said while cooperation among emergency workers is strong, \"formalized governance (leadership and planning) across regions has lagged.\" \n \nThe study, conducted by the Homeland Security Department, was likely to add fuel to what looms as a battle in Congress this year. Democrats, who take over the majority this week, have promised to try fixing the problem emergency agencies have communicating with each other but have not said specifically what they will do, how much it will cost or how they will pay for it. \n \n\"Five years after 9\/11, we continue to turn a deaf ear to gaps in interoperable communications,\" the term used for emergency agencies' abilities to talk to each other, said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. \"If it didn't have such potentially devastating consequences, it would be laughable.\" \n \nHomeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke would not comment on the report, saying only that in releasing it on Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff will \"talk about nationwide assessments for interoperable communications.\" \n \nStill room for improvement in New York \nThe attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, revealed major problems in how well emergency agencies were able to talk to each other during a catastrophe. Many firefighters climbing the World Trade Center towers died when they were unable to hear police radio warnings to leave the crumbling buildings. \n \nIn New York now, the report said, first responders were found to have well-established systems to communicate among each other \u2014 but not the best possible. Thirteen U.S. cities scored better than New York. \n \nJust over a year ago, Hurricane Katrina underscored communication problems when radio transmissions were hindered because the storm's winds toppled towers. \n \nIn the study, communities were judged in three categories: operating procedures in place, use of communications systems and how effectively local governments have coordinated in preparation for a disaster. \n \nOverall, 16 percent of the communities were given the highest score for the communications procedures they have in place and 1 percent got the lowest rating. \n \nNineteen percent got the top grade for their plans for coordinating during a disaster and 8 percent received the worst; and 21 percent got the best mark for how well they use their communications equipment while 4 percent got the bottom rating. \n \nMost of the areas surveyed included cities and their surrounding communities, based on the assumption that in a major crisis emergency personnel from all local jurisdictions would respond. \n \nLos Angeles got advanced grades in procedures and use of emergency communications systems and a well-developed grade in coordination of governance. \n \nSan Francisco, by comparison, received intermediate grades in governance and procedures, and a well-developed grade in use of systems. \n \nSince the Sept. 11 attacks, $2.9 billion in federal grant money has been distributed to state and local first responders for the improvement of their emergency communications systems. \n \nTV industry must make changes \nCongress has also ordered that the television broadcast industry vacate a portion of the radio spectrum to make it available for public safety communications. Lawmakers have also created a new office at the Homeland Security Department to oversee the issue, though they have yet to provide money for it. \n \nThe areas with the six best scores were judged advanced in all three categories. The cities with the lowest grades had reached the early implementation stage for only one category, and intermediate levels for the other two categories. \n \nChicago, Cleveland and Baton Rouge, for example, were judged to have accomplished the early stage of government coordination. Mandan, N.D., and the territory of American Samoa were both found to have gotten to the early stage of their actual usage of interoperable emergency communications and rated intermediate in governance and procedures. \n \nTammy Lapp, the emergency coordinator for Mandan and Morton County, N.D., said she was not surprised by the low ranking. \n \n\"We knew with our limited funds, we were going to fall short,\" she said.

{"docId":"USN16444287.txt","text":"Muslim with U.S. family is held, turned away \nAuthorities detain businessman of Syrian descent for four days in Las Vegas \n \nFRESNO, Calif. - A German businessman of Syrian descent who wanted to surprise his daughter with a holiday visit was detained for four days in a Las Vegas holding cell before being sent back home without explanation. \n \nA civil rights group called the U.S. authorities\u2019 treatment of Majed Shehadeh a case of anti-Muslim discrimination. \n \nShehadeh, 62, flew from Frankfurt to Las Vegas last Thursday, hoping to meet with his wife and drive to Bakersfield, California, where his American-born daughter had just gotten news she had passed the California bar exam. Instead, he wound up shivering in a holding cell without ever being told why he couldn\u2019t enter the country, he said. \n \nRoxanne Hercules, a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, confirmed Tuesday that Shehadeh was denied entry, but would not discuss specifics of his case. She said Shehadeh\u2019s visa waiver could have been denied because \u201che could have a criminal record, or it could be a terrorism issue.\u201d \n \nThe detention follows a series of similar incidents involving Muslim passengers, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \n \nIn October, an Islamic scholar from South Africa was denied entry at San Francisco International Airport. A month later, six imams were taken off a US Airways flight from Minneapolis to Phoenix after a passenger reported overhearing them criticize the U.S. war in Iraq. \n \n\u201cOverall these cases send a message that Muslims are second-class citizens who can be detained and kept from their families,\u201d said Affad Shaikh, a civil rights coordinator for CAIR. \n \n\u2018Nobody ever informed me why\u2019 \nShehadeh touched down Thursday afternoon on a direct Condor Airlines flight to McCarran International Airport, where his American wife was waiting to pick him up. The couple had planned to visit family in the Las Vegas area, before surprising their daughter for the New Year and celebrating her wedding anniversary in Central California. \n \n\u201cI gave them my German passport, and he looked to see which countries I visited. He found I had stamps that looked like Arabic and asked if they were fake,\u201d Shehadeh said Tuesday in a phone interview from his home in Alzenau, a small Bavarian village. \n \n\u201cNobody ever informed me why I was being questioned,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that was ever told to me was this had to do with Washington.\u201d \n \nAfter being interrogated by Border Protection and FBI agents for more than 12 hours at the airport, Shehadeh said he was handcuffed and transported in the back of police car to a North Las Vegas jail. Officials told family members they had denied Shehadeh\u2019s visa waiver, which grants German citizens the right to enter the U.S. with no additional paperwork, said his wife Joanne Mulligan. \n \nOfficials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said they could not comment on why he was denied entry. FBI and airport officials in Las Vegas also declined comment. \n \n\u2018Never even had a speeding ticket\u2019 \nAn aide to Sen. Dianne Feinstein later told the family that Shehadeh was on a \u201clook-out list,\u201d Mulligan said. Feinstein\u2019s office confirmed Tuesday that the family contacted her, but wouldn\u2019t comment further. \n \n\u201cI said you\u2019ve got to be joking me, he\u2019s never even had a speeding ticket,\u201d said Mulligan, a retired math teacher for the U.S. military. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re Muslims, and we travel a lot. Maybe the countries we travel to are not the countries they want you to visit.\u201d \n \nOnce in the holding facility, Shehadeh said he was stripped of his shoes, jacket and prescribed heart medicine and locked in a cell with about 25 other detainees. There was one toilet in the middle of the room, and access to a telephone was extremely limited, he said. \n \nOn Sunday, he was released and sent back to Frankfurt on the same charter airline. \n \nShehadeh\u2019s daughter Majida Shehadeh said she was glad her father made it home, but feared he wouldn\u2019t be able to return to visit. \n \n\u201cI used to be happy I moved here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now I can\u2019t wait for when I leave here. The mentality is not what it was like beforehand.\u201d

{"docId":"Wor13259309.txt","text":"Al-Maliki adviser says official who supervised execution is target of probe \n \nBAGHDAD, Iraq - Iraq\u2019s national security adviser told NBC News on Wednesday that three individuals have been arrested in connection with a video of Saddam Hussein\u2019s execution that was leaked. \n \n\u201cI can officially now confirm the arrest of three individuals in the case of the execution of Saddam Hussein,\u201d said Iraqi national security adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie. \n \nThe arrests came after the announcement that officials were interrogating the person suspected of recording Saddam\u2019s hanging via a mobile phone. \n \n\u201cThe person who filmed the execution process has been arrested. ... Now he is under interrogation about the goals of his filming,\u201d said an adviser to the prime minister, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. \u201cHe was arrested by Iraqi forces.\u201d \n \nThe video contained audio of witnesses telling Saddam to \u201cGo to hell\u201d and of the former leader responding to taunts that his tormentors were being unmanly. It surfaced on Al-Jazeera television and the Internet late Saturday, the day Saddam was hanged.  \n \nThe Associated Press quoted an unidentified adviser to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki as saying the man arrested was \u201can official who supervised the execution.\u201d  \n \nAl-Maliki announced Tuesday that he had ordered an investigation into the conduct of the execution team, who could be heard taunting Saddam in the moments before his hanging. \n \nA U.S. military spokesman, meanwhile, said the United States would have handled the execution differently had it been in charge.  \n \n\u2018I did not see him taking pictures\u2019 \nOn Wednesday, an Iraqi prosecutor who was also present at the execution denied a report that he had accused national security adviser al-Rubaie of possible responsibility for the leaked video. \n \n\u201cI am not accusing Mowaffak al-Rubaie, and I did not see him taking pictures,\u201d Munqith al-Faroon, a prosecutor in the case that sent Saddam to the gallows, told The Associated Press. \n \n\u201cBut I saw two of the government officials who were ... present during the execution taking all the video of the execution, using the lights that were there for the official taping of the execution. They used mobile phone cameras. I do not know their names, but I would remember their faces,\u201d al-Faroon said in a telephone interview. \n \nThe prosecutor said the two officials were openly taking video pictures, which are believed to be those which appeared on Al-Jazeera satellite and a Web site within hours of Saddam\u2019s execution. \n \nThe New York Times on Wednesday reported that al-Faroon told the newspaper \u201cone of two men he had seen holding a cell phone camera aloft to make a video of Mr. Hussein\u2019s last moments up to and past the point where he fell through the trapdoor was Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Mr. Maliki\u2019s national security adviser.\u201d \n \nThe Times said it had been unable to reach al-Rubaie for comment. AP also could not reach him Wednesday. His secretary said the security adviser, a close aide to al-Maliki, was in Najaf and would not return until later. \n \nChants of \u2018Muqtada\u2019 \nAl-Faroon said there were 14 Iraqi officials, including himself and another prosecutor, as well as three hangmen present for the execution. All the officials, he said, were flown by U.S. helicopter to the former military intelligence facility where Saddam was put to death in an execution chamber used by his own security men for years. \n \nThe prosecutor said he believed all mobile phones had been confiscated before the flight and that some of the officials\u2019 bodyguards, who arrived by car, had smuggled the camera phones to the two officials he had seen taking the video pictures. \n \nAl-Arabiya television reported that the person under arrest is one of the guards who was a member of the execution team, according to an MSNBC translator. There was no further information about whether the person under arrest was a guard or other official. \n \nSome of the last words Saddam heard, according to the leaked cell phone video, were a chant of \u201cMuqtada, Muqtada, Muqtada,\u201d a reference to Muqtada al-Sadr, the radical anti-American Shiite cleric, whose Mahdi Army militia is believed responsible for many killings that have targeted Sunnis and driven many from their homes. \n \nAl-Sadr\u2019s father was killed by Saddam. The militant cleric is a key al-Maliki backer. \n \nU.S. response \nMaj. Gen. William Caldwell, a U.S. military spokesman, told reporters Wednesday that the execution would have been handled differently had U.S. forces been in charge.  \n \n\u201cIf you are asking me: \u2018Would we have done things differently?\u2019 Yes, we would have. But that\u2019s not our decision. That\u2019s the government of Iraq\u2019s decision,\u201d he .  \n \nHe added that Saddam was \u201cdignified\u201d and \u201ccourteous\u201d as he was transferred from US military control to Iraqi custody before he was executed.  \n \n\u201cHe spoke very well to our military police, as he always had, and when getting off at the prison site he said farewell to his interpreter; he thanked the military police squad,\u201d Caldwell said.

{"docId":"Wor16447201.txt","text":"Hindus throng to Ganges for bathing festival \nPilgrims believe dip in river during six week celebration will cleanse sin \n \nALLAHABAD, India - Nearly half a million Hindus braved near-freezing temperatures to wash away their sins in the icy waters of the Ganges river in northern India on Wednesday, the first day of a six-week festival. \n \nAs many as 70 million people from India and abroad are expected over the whole \u201cArdh Kumbh Mela\u201d or Half Pitcher Festival, billed as one of the largest gatherings on earth. \n \nMen, women, children, holy men in saffron and the infirm gathered at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and a mythical third river in Allahabad city well before dawn, waiting for the sun to rise for the auspicious bath on the first day of the 42-day event. \n \nThey chanted verses from Hindu scriptures and sang holy songs as they walked towards the bathing areas, some lying prostrate after every few steps to salute the gods. \n \nThe festival falls midway between the \u201cMaha Kumbh Mela\u201d or the Great Pitcher Festival, celebrated once every 12 years. \n \nHindus believe that bathing in the Ganges during the festivals cleanses them of sin, speeding the way to the attainment of nirvana or the afterlife. \n \n'Like being with God' \n \nAfter dipping in the polluted but sacred waters, many filled cans, bottles and steel containers for relatives and friends who could not make it. Others sprinkled it on their dry clothes.  \n \n\u201cIt was a long-cherished desire to take a dip here during the Kumbh Mela,\u201d said Naba Kumar Ghosh, a young school teacher from the eastern Indian state of West Bengal. \u201cThe experience has been one of fulfillment, a complete cleansing of the inner self.\u201d \n \nShakuntala, a 70-year-old woman who gave only one name, said she traveled all night from the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh to bathe in the Ganges, just as she has done at every Kumbh Mela over the last 25 years. \n \n\u201cIt was a divine experience, a dip in the holy waters is like being with God,\u201d she said. \u201cGod willing, I will be here for the next 'Kumbh' too\u201d. \n \nRama Devi, an old woman from Allahabad who could not remember her age, has not missed a single Kumbh and was determined to make it this time despite her inability to walk. \n \nWith roads closed to traffic, her 35-year-old son, a soldier in the Indian army, carried her on his back for the 6-mile walk from their house to the waters. \n \nTight security \nAllahabad, in the Hindi heartland state of Uttar Pradesh, is one of four spots where Garuda, the winged steed of Hindu god Vishnu, is said to have rested during a titanic battle with demons over a pitcher of divine nectar of immortality. \n \nGaruda\u2019s flight lasted 12 divine days, or 12 years of mortal time, hence the celebration of \u201cMaha Kumbh Mela\u201d every 12 years. \n \nThe midway point between two such celebrations is also considered highly favorable because the position of the sun and the moon are the same as during the \u201cMaha Kumbh\u201d. \n \nThe \u201cMaha Kumbh Mela\u201d in 1989 attracted 15 million pilgrims and the Guinness Book of Records dubbed it the largest gathering of human beings for a single purpose. The festival in 2001 drew between 50 and 70 million. \n \nThousands of tents and camps have been built to house pilgrims across the 4,000 acre  festival area and more than 10,000 policemen, including specially-trained \u201cterrorist spotters\u201d, have been deployed, authorities said. \n
